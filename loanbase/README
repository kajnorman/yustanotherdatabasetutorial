This directory holds a number of files that will allow building a small webinterfaced database system.

A number of shell scripts will handle the tasks of deploying, or rolling back theese facilities


for this to work the user running the scripts must have write permission to /var/www/html


This may be done as  :  
	sudo chmod a+w /var/www (before running the scripts)
	running the scripts as root :  sudo ./deploy.bash
	Or making a group of webdevelopers and give acces through group permissions


Files:

deploy.bash		will copy all rellevant files to /var/www/html
createdatabase.bash	will create the database from scratch with few elements
//  not in this version ....  remove.bash 		will remove all copied files (from this project) from /var/www
displaydata.bash	will display data on the console
index.html		will show a "home page" for the database(with links)
old_loans.php		will display a list of all loans from the database
test.php		for testing differet features of php and html



TODO
	Consider the lack of security in the project
